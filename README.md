# Installation

Installing the Hola theme can be done in one of two ways. Our GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the theme with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file. 

The theme by itself is useful, but you may have an easier time getting up and running by installing a skeleton. The skeleton can be found in [Hola Skeleton](https://github.com/devlom/grav-hola-skeleton) package which are self-contained repositories for a complete sites which include: sample content, configuration, theme, and plugins.

## GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install hola

This will install the Hola theme into your `/user/themes` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/themes/hola`.

## Manual Installation

To install this theme, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/themes`. Then, rename the folder to `hola`. You can find these files either on [GitHub](https://github.com/devlom/grav-theme-hola) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/themes).

You should now have all the theme files under

    /your/site/grav/user/themes/hola

## Default Options

Hola comes with a few default options that can be set site-wide.  These options are:

```yaml
enabled: true                 # Enable the theme
production-mode: true         # In production mode, only minified CSS is used. When disabled, nested CSS with sourcemaps are enabled
header-fixed: true            # Cause the header to be fixed at the top of the browser
header-animated: true         # Allows the fixed header to resize to a smaller header when scrolled
header-dark: false            # Inverts the text/logo to work better on dark backgrounds
header-transparent: false     # Allows the fixed header to be transparent over the page
sticky-footer: true           # Causes the footer to be sticky at the bottom of the page
blog-page: '/blog'            # The route to the blog listing page, useful for a blog style layout with sidebar
custom_logo:                  # A custom logo rather than the default (see below)  
custom_logo_mobile:           # A custom logo to use for mobile navigation
```

To make modifications, you can copy the `user/themes/hola/hola.yaml` file to `user/config/themes/` folder and modify, or you can use the admin plugin.

> NOTE: Do not modify the `user/themes/hola/hola.yaml` file directly or your changes will be lost with any updates

## Custom Logos

To add a custom logo, you should put the log into the `user/themes/hola/images/logo` folder.  Standard image formats are support (`.png`,`.jpg`, `.gif`, `.svg`, etc.).  Then reference the logo via the YAML like so:

```yaml
custom_logo:
    - name: 'my-logo.png'
custom_logo_mobile:
    - name: 'my-mobile-logo.png'    
```

Alternatively, you can you use the drag-n-drop "Custom Logo" field in the Hola theme options.

## Page Overrides

Hola has the ability to allow pages to override some of the default options by letting the user set `body_classes` for any page.  The theme will merge the combination of the defaults with any `body_classes` set. For example:

```yaml
body_classes: "header-dark header-transparent"
```

On a particular page will ensure that page has those options enabled (assuming they are false by default).

## Features Modular Options

The features modular template provides the ability to set a class on the features, as well as an array of feature items.  For example:

```yaml
class: offset-box
features:
    - header: Crazy Fast
      text: "Performance is not just an afterthought, we baked it in from the start!"
      icon: fighter-jet
    - header: Easy to build
      text: "Simple text files means Grav is trivial to install, and easy to maintain"

      icon: puzzle-piece
    - header: Free / Open Source
      text: "Grav is an open source project, so you can spend your money on other stuff"
      icon: money 
```

## Modular Hola Settings

Additional options found in every modular section. It can be used to unlock additional functions such as:

```yaml
